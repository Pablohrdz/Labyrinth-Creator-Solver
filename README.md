# Labyrinth-Creator and Solver
This is a project aimed to get a better understanding of graph algorithms. Labyrinths with or without loops are randomly generated and then solved by the computer. For both generating and solving these, multiple algorithms can be utilized. Among the most popular ones are depth and breadth-first search, Dijkstra's, Kruskal and Prim's, Eller's algorithm, and A*.

It uses Java and Processing's innate methods to display the labyrinths and animations.
